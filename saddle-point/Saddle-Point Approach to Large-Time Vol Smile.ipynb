    "I think Merton-jump model with following extensions can potentially fit a smile of rich curvatures. In Merton we assume Gaussian log-jumps obeying Poisson arrival - this has a (finite-activity) Gaussian Levy measure. With sufficiently many Gaussians (with different arrival rates $\\lambda$ and spreads $\\sigma^2$) this seems to match arbitrary Levy measure. More precisely, any Levy measure may be represented in superposition of compound Poisson processes\n",

    "\n",
    "Activity is controlled by $\\lambda$ - say for infinite activity, $\\lambda$ integrates to infinity. This probably has too many degrees of freedom $\\{\\lambda(\\alpha), \\sigma^2(\\alpha)\\}$ - extra constraints are needed. This\n",
    "essentially says, any function may be expanded in Gaussian basis - I think this is very plausible. Now that we have a Levy measure flexible enough, this fits complex smile.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to do is, work out large-time Merton smile and study its curvature, then progressively add Poisson jumps and observe how this changes curvature."
