    "Condition $\\phi_T(u-i/2) \\sim e^{-\\psi(u)T}$ says: in large time log-spot evolves like a Levy process (of independent and stationary increments), and large-time smile converges to a stationary state. Independence leads to scaling in $T$ in exponent; stationarity leads to time-independent factor $\\psi(u)$.\n",

    "Our saddle-point trick works for Levy processes (by definition), and some path-dependent processes that forget about its initial states over time e.g.\\ Heston/SVJ due to mean-reversion of vol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Smile properties depend entirely on factor $\\omega(x)$. If we want a complex smile of rich curvatures (say crazy W-shape), we have to design a $\\psi(u)$ complex enough, that fulfills martingale condition $\\psi(-i/2) = 0$ -- is $\\psi(u)$, rather than log-spot process $X_T$, the night thing to start with? By Levy-Khintchine representation it seems there exists some Levy measure integrated to match $\\psi$, at least in theory, though we risk a totally incomprehensible Levy measure. Another question is, does arbitrary $\\psi(u)$ (that fulfills martingale conditon) contain arbitrage?\n",

    "To make this precise, say we want a pure-jump process (ignore drift/diffusion for now) obeying some Levy measure $\\mu(\\xi)$ that fulfills $\\psi(u)$. By Levy-Khintchine, characteristic function reads\n",

    "\n",
    "I think Merton-jump model with following extensions can potentially fit a smile of rich curvatures. In Merton we assume Gaussian log-jumps obeying Poisson arrival -- this has a (finite-activity) Gaussian Levy measure. With sufficiently many Gaussians (with different arrival rates $\\lambda$ and spreads $\\sigma^2$) this seems to match arbitrary Levy measure. More precisely, any Levy measure may be represented in superposition of compound Poisson processes\n",

    "\n",
    "Activity is controlled by $\\lambda$ -- say for infinite activity, $\\lambda$ integrates to infinity. This probably has too many degrees of freedom $\\{\\lambda(\\alpha), \\sigma^2(\\alpha)\\}$ -- extra constraints are needed. This\n",
    "essentially says, any function may be expanded in Gaussian basis -- I think this is very plausible. Now that we have a Levy measure flexible enough, this fits complex smile.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to do is, work out large-time Merton smile and study its curvature, then progressively add Poisson jumps and observe how this changes curvature."
